This is a project to implement KWIC (Key World In Context) in 2 architectural designs (ADT & Pipe and Filter)(Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Download the codes from :https://github.com/TIC3001/tic3001-ay2122s2-15.git
2. Extract the zip file downloaded.

3. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)

4. To run "Abstract Data Type" option:
	Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   	a. Click `Open`.
   	b. Search for the correct directory:
	Downloads(if you extract here) ---> tic3001-ay2122s2-15-master ---> src ---> main ---> java ---> Select `abstract_data_type` and click `OK`.
   	c. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.

5. To run "Pipe & Filter" option: 
	Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   	a. Click `Open`.
   	b. Search for the correct directory:
	Downloads(if you extract here) ---> tic3001-ay2122s2-15-master ---> src ---> main ---> java ---> Select `pipeline` and click `OK`.
   	c. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.

6. Go to `Project Strcuture`, Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) and choose 'Project language level' to the `SDK default` option.

7. (Abstract Data Type)option - After that, locate the `Main` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Main.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
   Please enter your input text file name with Extension (.txt): 

8. (Pipe & Filter)option - After that, locate the `PipeAndFilter` file, right-click it, and choose `Run PipeAndFilter.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
   Please enter the text file name with Extension (.txt):
